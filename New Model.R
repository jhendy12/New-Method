#Function will need to:
#  Input
#Species names 
#Multiple binary traits for each species (perennial v annual)
#Multiple determinant binary traits for each species (flower v non-flower crops)		

#Install appropriate libraries
#Load appropriate libraries
#Input data

#Set input parameters
#Tell function which traits are determinant and which ones are not
#Return list of determinant traits and non-determinant traits

#Build a tree
#Or should I just require a premade tree?
#How should tree be built?

#Use Pagel to map traits on tree
#Constrain tree root to match wild type
#Phytools - fitPagel()
#Use Pagel to 
#Compare these traits correlated to a binary determinant trait (wild type v domesticate)
#Do this for multiple determinant traits


#End goal of function
#Tell which traits are correlated with which determinant traits
